                <h2>Islamic Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    The Islamic aspect of our vision is all-encompassing i.e. it is not a mere Muslim school. It’s about training the Muslim child in the proper memorization and recitation of the glorious Quran; 
                    eloquent communication in Arabic; exposition to the knowledge of Hadeeth; acquisition of the Islamic etiquettes (Adab) and so many more.

                <h2>Conventional/Secular Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    The secular part cuts across all Government-approved subjects, from the primary section to the secondary including Information Technology (IT), which is uncompromisingly, accorded a high level of priority. 
                    In pursuance of this lofty goal, each learner is made to have a laptop which he uses from time to time through the teaching-guidance of experts employed mainly for the purpose.

                <h2>World Class Technology</h2>
                <p>
                        Al-Qalam academy within its short year of existence has been able to achieve the seemingly impossible. The availability of Information Technology (I.T) facility will not only make learning easy, 
                        but also give close monitoring of wards by their parents and guardians in just a click away.

                <h2>Perfect Combination</h2>
                <p>
                        Al-Qalam Academy, successfully, has so far been able to do the seemingly undoable i.e. combining a full-fledged Islamic school with secular education, 
                        where the two are run concurrently with injury to none. 
                        The day and boarding system also make Al-Qalam flexible to the yearnings of the populace.
